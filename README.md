This project analyzes the **Netflix dataset** using **advanced SQL queries** to derive insights about content production, release trends, and business strategy.  
The objective is to provide **data-driven recommendations** for optimizing content strategy.

- **Size:** 8,807 records, 12 columns

  3. Year-wise content release trend
  4. Most common genres
  5. Countries producing maximum shows
  6. … and more
- Optimized queries using **CTEs**, **Window Functions**, and **Joins**

## 📊 Example Insights
